# Getting Started

This guide is going to walk you through the RAUI concepts and how to use RAUI in a [Tetra] game. Because RAUI is renderer agnostic, you don't have to use Tetra, you can write your own backend for your favorite game engine or rendering framework, but because Tetra is one of the officially supported backends we will start off with that.

You can find the finished version of the demo app we will be making in this guide in the [guide demo code][demo].
