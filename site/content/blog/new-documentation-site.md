With this new blog section we will also be able to make development announcements to help keep the community in the loop about what's going on with the project.

We've made a lot of progress but there's still tons of work to do. If you find bugs, or have feature requests, don't hesitate to open a [GitHub issue][issue]! And if you have questions or comments feel free to open a [discussion].
